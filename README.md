# TTSDL
I rescued this codebase from an aging harddrive. It appears to be an attempt
at cloning TGM1, but in it's early stages and very far from completion. In
other words, it is like Tetris.

There's a lot of bugs. I could fix them, or I could leave them. Either way,
here's a window into what my C code looked like approximately 5 years ago.
It's not very good, but in my defense, the ctime/mtime was only a couple days
apart. Guess it was just a hasty job.

I don't really think there's any reason to use this codebase. There's not much
to it other than that it does in fact work.
